Feature Selection 
=================

The features selected for this database come from the accelerometer, magnetometer and gyroscope 3-axial raw signals tAcc-XYZ, tMag-XYZ and tGyro-XYZ. These time domain signals (prefix 't' to denote time) were captured at a constant rate of 50 Hz. Then they were filtered using a low pass filter with a corner frequency of 25 Hz to remove noise. Finally they got normalized into scale range [-1,1].

The set of variables that were estimated from these signals are: 

mean(): Mean value
std(): Standard deviation
max(): Largest value in array
min(): Smallest value in array
mad(): Median absolute deviation
sma(): Signal magnitude area


The complete list of variables of each feature vector is available in 'features.txt'
